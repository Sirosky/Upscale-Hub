# ‚ú® How to Upscale

- Want to upscale a video? [Take a look here](https://github.com/Sirosky/Upscale-Hub/wiki/%F0%9F%93%BA-How-to-Upscale-a-Video).
- Want to upscale an image or multiple images? [Take a look here](https://github.com/Sirosky/Upscale-Hub/wiki/%F0%9F%93%B7-How-to-Upscale-an-Image-or-Multiple-Images).

# üë∑ Under Construction

- Building out the video upscaling guide.
- Update to AniSD DC.

# üìà How to Train Your Own Model

If you're looking for a guide on how to train your own model, check out the following:

- [Training a Model in neosr](https://github.com/Sirosky/Upscale-Hub/wiki/%F0%9F%93%88-Training-a-Model-in-NeoSR)- A guide I wrote which is up-to-date with current training methodologies, and my totally unbiased personal takes.
- [Training an image upscaling model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH7-eYlf7eg)- For those that prefer the video format. I recommend using neosr, but much of the information is still applicable.
- [Additional resources for training](https://github.com/Kim2091/training-info) - A list of additional resources and other information for training purposes, prepared by Kim2091.

### **Legacy Models**

Looking for one of my older models? You can [still find them here](https://github.com/Sirosky/Upscale-Hub/blob/main/Legacy/Legacy%20Models.md).

# ü§ù Tools Utilized and Acknowledgements

- [chaiNNer](https://chainner.app/) by Joey and contributors: The backbone of any of my bulk image processing and upscaling process. These models would not be possible without ChaiNNer.
- [ImgAlign](https://github.com/sonic41592/ImgAlign) by sonic41592: A fantastic little tool which can automate one of those tedious parts of image pair dataset preparation.
- [Image Pearer](https://github.com/Sirosky/Image-Pearer): A tool to automate the image pairing process by yours truly. Allows automation of the _other_ most tedious part of the image pair dataset preparation process.
- [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/): A fantastic resource for all things upscaling.
- [neosr](https://github.com/muslll/neosr) by muslll: The hottest new training platform! neosr now has its own Discord, which can be found [here](https://discord.gg/NN2HGtJ3d6).
- [TraiNNer Redux and Forks](https://github.com/joeyballentine/traiNNer-redux) by Joey, muslll and other contributors. While I've largely moved over to neosr, I've spent a LOT of time on Redux.
- [Dataset Destroyer](https://github.com/Kim2091/helpful-scripts/tree/main/Dataset%20Destroyer) by Kim2091: A crucial part of the dataset preparation process that makes image degradation oh so easy!
- The developers and contributors to neural network models such as [ESRGAN]([url](https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN)), [SRVGGNetCompact]([url](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)), [OmniSR](https://github.com/Francis0625/Omni-SR), [SwinIR]([url](https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR)) and more for developing the networks on which these models are based.
- [Simple Image Compare](https://github.com/Sirosky/Simple-Image-Compare): Another tool by yours truly. A minimalistic image comparison tool which I developed because ICAT sucks.
- [AnimeJaNai Converter GUI](https://github.com/the-database/AnimeJaNaiConverterGui) by the database: The easiest way to start upscaling videos.
- And last but certainly not least, the [Enhance Everything Discord community](https://discord.gg/cpAUpDK) for their invaluable support and guidance. I also blame them for my neural network training addiction.
